# Arithmetically Astrals Front End Captstone project

### Overview

The Front End Capstone(FEC) project is an e-commerce site that made with React and Express following a business requirements document and using an API provided by the project stakeholders. Our team was tasked to create a dynamic and modern user interface to enhance the client experience. We challenged ourselves to use technologies that were new to use such as React hooks, Sass, and Jest. To keep our workflow organized we used daily stand-up mettings along with Trello to keep track of individual engineers progress and used Git workflow techniques along with code reviews/testing to keep our code stable.

This section allows the user to view and interact with the questions and answers for a given product. The user can use a query and search for a question in the product regardless of whether it is rendered or not, and the app will return a list of questions that match that query and highlight the matched area for increased visibility. The user can see more questions or answers by clicking buttons, and mark questions or answers as helpful. They can also report answers, which will be marked in the API as such and will no longer be rendered for future page loads. The user can click an image to see a modal of that image at full resolution. Finally, the user has the ability to add questions and answers by clicking on their respective buttons, which will open a modal asking them for valid and respective inputs.
