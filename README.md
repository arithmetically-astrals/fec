# Arithmetically Astrals Front End Captstone project

### Overview

The Front End Capstone(FEC) project is an e-commerce site that made with React and Express following a business requirements document and using an API provided by the project stakeholders. Our team was tasked to create a dynamic and modern user interface to enhance the client experience. We challenged ourselves to use technologies that were new to use such as React hooks, Sass, and Jest. To keep our workflow organized we used daily stand-up mettings along with Trello to keep track of individual engineers progress and used Git workflow techniques along with code reviews/testing to keep our code stable.
